# simpleMANET
simpleMANET is an extremely simple MANET simulator and topology visualization tool for Matlab.

It's a standalone MATLAB project that works out-of-the-box.
Just add its folder and subfolders to the path and type "manet" in the command window. 
That's it!

It was developed for quick design and evaluation of MANET routing protocols, no C++ or C programming required.
simpleMANET's object-oriented nature ensures simple, intuitive protocol development as well as great visualization of the dynamic topologies via MATLAB embedded graphics.

For the details on how to add your own custom protocol and/or change settings refer to Wiki.
